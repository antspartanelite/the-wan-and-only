# the-wan-and-only
A discord bot with various miscellaneous functions, mostly coded in early hours of the morning so don't expect great code.

Also yes there is barely any commenting, I'll get around to it at some point if I have time/start losing track of what is happening in the code

All dependencies required for the bot to run correctly should be in the package.json

Also you will want to add a file named config.json and put it in the root directory of the bot. It shoud have the following formatting:

{
  "token" : "Your discord bot token goes inbetween these two speech marks",
  "ytAPIkey" : "Your youtube api key goes inbetween these two speech marks"
}
